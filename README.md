During the development of [my website](https://domenicotenace.dev/), I thought: "why not develop something standard that I can use as a basis for other projects and make it open source?"
<br/>
Astro Minimal is an open source blog template designed and developed using Astro and the Bulma CSS framework ðŸš€
